# ${1:Tableau Server Usage Tracking}
Simple Python Program to extract tables from the Tableau Server Postgres DB for the purpose of saving off the _http_requests table which is truncated every Tableau Server Backup.  The contents of these tables are saved as text files and copied to shared drive.  Extracts can then be created off of the flat files in the shared drive so the data is automatically updated.
